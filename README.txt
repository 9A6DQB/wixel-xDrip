Pololu Wixel Software Development Kit (SDK)

This package contains code, utilities, and Makefiles that will
help you build your own applications for the Pololu Wixel, a
programmable USB wireless module based around the CC2511F32 chip
from Texas Instruments.

For documentation of this SDK, see:
http://pololu.github.com/wixel-sdk

(You can also generate the documentation yourself by running
Doxygen on libraries/Doxyfile.)

For more information about the Wixel, see the Wixel User's Guide:
