DexDrip for Wixel
=================

### What is it?
This project can be loaded onto a wixel, it will catch the wireless signals
sent from a dexcom transmitter, read, break up the different parts, and then send it using UART so it can be
retransmitted through Bluetooth

### Whats a dexcom?
Its an amazing CGM (continue glucose monitor) that many Diabetics use to keep
track of their glucose levels in real(ish)time

### Why this then?
The current dexcom has its own proprietary reciever that unfortunately cannot
talk to phones unless using a project like
[NightScount](http://www.nightscout.info/) Which in its current form requires
an android phone to be plugged into the reciever, which can be costly and
bulky.
