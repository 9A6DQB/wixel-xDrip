DexDrip for Wixel
=================

### What is it?
This project can be loaded onto a wixel, it will catch the wireless signals
sent from a dexcom transmitter, read, break up the different parts, and then send it using UART so it can be
retransmitted through Bluetooth

### Whats a dexcom?
Its an amazing CGM (continue glucose monitor) that many Diabetics use to keep
track of their glucose levels in real(ish)time

### Why this then?
The current dexcom has its own proprietary reciever that unfortunately cannot
talk to phones unless using a project like
[NightScount](http://www.nightscout.info/) Which is an awesome project I HIGHLY recomend you check out

# HUGE PROPS TO:
Adrien De Croy for writing most of this for his Dexterity Prject!

Lorelai for pointing me to all of these great resources and then also allowing me to use large portions of her code.

John Stevens for further improving on Adrians code, which I also then used!!


Wow.. Im begining to think I didnt do anything other than copy and paste these peoples works...


Don Brown over at [dexwatch](http://dexwatch.blogspot.com/) for initially pointing
out that this is a possibility to me!

Ben West, John Costik and Scott Leibrand their awesome work with Nightscout and various other projects!
